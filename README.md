# Proof of liquidity

Having liquidity only allows you to recover fees on the swap. What if we gave liquidity providers other privileges, such as a reduced fee on the different accounts the liquidity provider uses?

Thanks to the zkproof, the liquidity provider will be able to obtain fee reductions on all his accounts, without his accounts disclosing which liquidity provider he corresponds to.
